# Plugin Integration Patterns

Commands can integrate with other plugin components for powerful workflows.

## Agent Integration

Launch plugin agents for complex tasks:

```markdown
---
description: Deep code review
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Initiate comprehensive review of @$1 using the code-reviewer agent.

The agent will analyze:

- Code structure
- Security issues
- Performance
- Best practices

Agent uses plugin resources:

- ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/rules.json
- ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/checklists/review.md
```

**Key points:**

- Agent must exist in `plugin/agents/` directory
- Claude uses Task tool to launch agent
- Document agent capabilities
- Reference plugin resources agent uses

## Skill Integration

Leverage plugin skills for specialized knowledge:

```markdown
---
description: Document API with standards
argument-hint: [api-file]
---

Document API in @$1 following plugin standards.

Use the api-docs-standards skill to ensure:

- Complete endpoint documentation
- Consistent formatting
- Example quality
- Error documentation

Generate production-ready API docs.
```

**Key points:**

- Skill must exist in `plugin/skills/` directory
- Mention skill name to trigger invocation
- Document skill purpose
- Explain what skill provides

## Hook Coordination

Design commands that work with plugin hooks:

- Commands can prepare state for hooks to process
- Hooks execute automatically on tool events
- Commands should document expected hook behavior
- Guide Claude on interpreting hook output

See `plugin-features-reference.md` for examples of commands that coordinate with hooks.

## Multi-Component Workflows

Combine agents, skills, and scripts:

```markdown
---
description: Comprehensive review workflow
argument-hint: [file]
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), Read
---

Target: @$1

Phase 1 - Static Analysis:
`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.js $1`

Phase 2 - Deep Review:
Launch code-reviewer agent for detailed analysis.

Phase 3 - Standards Check:
Use coding-standards skill for validation.

Phase 4 - Report:
Template: @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/review.md

Compile findings into report following template.
```

**When to use:**

- Complex multi-step workflows
- Leverage multiple plugin capabilities
- Require specialized analysis
- Need structured outputs

## Validation Patterns

Commands should validate inputs and resources before processing.

### Argument Validation

```markdown
---
description: Deploy with validation
argument-hint: [environment]
---

Validate environment: `echo "$1" | grep -E "^(dev|staging|prod)$" || echo "INVALID"`

If $1 is valid environment:
Deploy to $1
Otherwise:
Explain valid environments: dev, staging, prod
Show usage: /deploy [environment]
```

### File Existence Checks

```markdown
---
description: Process configuration
argument-hint: [config-file]
---

Check file exists: `test -f $1 && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"`

If file exists:
Process configuration: @$1
Otherwise:
Explain where to place config file
Show expected format
Provide example configuration
```

### Plugin Resource Validation

```markdown
---
description: Run plugin analyzer
allowed-tools: Bash(test:*)
---

Validate plugin setup:

- Script: `test -x ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/analyze && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`
- Config: `test -f ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`

If all checks pass, run analysis.
Otherwise, report missing components.
```

### Error Handling

```markdown
---
description: Build with error handling
allowed-tools: Bash(*)
---

Execute build: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build.sh 2>&1 || echo "BUILD_FAILED"`

If build succeeded:
Report success and output location
If build failed:
Analyze error output
Suggest likely causes
Provide troubleshooting steps
```

**Best practices:**

- Validate early in command
- Provide helpful error messages
- Suggest corrective actions
- Handle edge cases gracefully
