# Skill Creation Workflow

This reference provides detailed step-by-step instructions for creating skills for Claude Code plugins. For an overview, see the main SKILL.md.

## Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

## Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

### Examples

**pdf-editor skill** for queries like "Help me rotate this PDF":

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

**frontend-webapp-builder skill** for queries like "Build me a todo app":

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful

**big-query skill** for queries like "How many users have logged in today?":

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful

**hooks skill** for Claude Code plugins:

1. Developers repeatedly need to validate hooks.json and test hook scripts
2. `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh` and `scripts/test-hook.sh` utilities would be helpful
3. `references/patterns.md` for detailed hook patterns to avoid bloating SKILL.md

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

## Step 3: Create Skill Structure

For Claude Code plugins, create the skill directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p plugin-name/skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}
touch plugin-name/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Note:** Unlike the generic skill-creator which uses `init_skill.py`, plugin skills are created directly in the plugin's `skills/` directory with a simpler manual structure.

## Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-created or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.

### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. Create only the directories actually needed (references/, examples/, scripts/).

### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X" or "If you need to do X"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.

**Description (Frontmatter):** Use third-person format with specific trigger phrases:

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", "specific phrase 3". Include exact phrases users would say that should trigger this skill. Be concrete and specific.
---
```

**Good description examples:**

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop).
```

**Bad description examples:**

```yaml
description: Use this skill when working with hooks.  # Wrong person, vague
description: Load when user needs hook help.  # Not third person
description: Provides hook guidance.  # No trigger phrases
```

To complete SKILL.md body, answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?
2. When should the skill be used? (Include this in frontmatter description with specific triggers)
3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.

**Keep SKILL.md lean:** Target 1,500-2,000 words for the body. Move detailed content to references/:

- Detailed patterns → `references/patterns.md`
- Advanced techniques → `references/advanced.md`
- Migration guides → `references/migration.md`
- API references → `references/api-reference.md`

**Reference resources in SKILL.md:**

```markdown
## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For detailed patterns and techniques, consult:

- **`references/patterns.md`** - Common patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced use cases

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:

- **`example-script.sh`** - Working example
```

## Step 5: Validate and Test

**For plugin skills, validation is different from generic skills:**

1. **Check structure**: Skill directory in `plugin-name/skills/skill-name/`
2. **Validate SKILL.md**: Has frontmatter with name and description
3. **Check trigger phrases**: Description includes specific user queries
4. **Verify writing style**: Body uses imperative/infinitive form, not second person
5. **Test progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is lean (~1,500-2,000 words), detailed content in references/
6. **Check references**: All referenced files exist
7. **Validate examples**: Examples are complete and correct
8. **Test scripts**: Scripts are executable and work correctly

**Use the skill-reviewer agent:**

```
Ask: "Review my skill and check if it follows best practices"
```

The skill-reviewer agent will check description quality, content organization, and progressive disclosure.

## Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

**Common improvements:**

- Strengthen trigger phrases in description
- Move long sections from SKILL.md to references/
- Add missing examples or scripts
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Add edge case handling

## Progressive Disclosure in Practice

### What Goes in SKILL.md

**Include (always loaded when skill triggers):**

- Core concepts and overview
- Essential procedures and workflows
- Quick reference tables
- Pointers to references/examples/scripts
- Most common use cases

Keep under 3,000 words, ideally 1,500-2,000 words.

### What Goes in references/

**Move to references/ (loaded as needed):**

- Detailed patterns and advanced techniques
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Migration guides
- Edge cases and troubleshooting
- Extensive examples and walkthroughs

Each reference file can be large (2,000-5,000+ words).

### What Goes in examples/

**Working code examples:**

- Complete, runnable scripts
- Configuration files
- Template files
- Real-world usage examples

Users can copy and adapt these directly.

### What Goes in scripts/

**Utility scripts:**

- Validation tools
- Testing helpers
- Parsing utilities
- Automation scripts

Should be executable and documented.

## Writing Style Guide

### Imperative/Infinitive Form

Write using verb-first instructions, not second person:

**Correct (imperative):**

```
To create a hook, define the event type.
Configure the MCP server with authentication.
Validate settings before use.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**

```
You should create a hook by defining the event type.
You need to configure the MCP server.
You must validate settings before use.
```

### Third-Person in Description

The frontmatter description must use third person:

**Correct:**

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**

```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load this skill when user asks...
```

### Objective, Instructional Language

Focus on what to do, not who should do it:

**Correct:**

```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**

```
You can parse the frontmatter...
Claude should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Weak Trigger Description

**Bad:**

```yaml
description: Provides guidance for working with hooks.
```

Why bad: Vague, no specific trigger phrases, not third person

**Good:**

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", or mentions hook events. Provides comprehensive hooks API guidance.
```

Why good: Third person, specific phrases, concrete scenarios

### Mistake 2: Too Much in SKILL.md

**Bad:**

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md  (8,000 words - everything in one file)
```

Why bad: Bloats context when skill loads, detailed content always loaded

**Good:**

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md  (1,800 words - core essentials)
└── references/
    ├── patterns.md (2,500 words)
    └── advanced.md (3,700 words)
```

Why good: Progressive disclosure, detailed content loaded only when needed

### Mistake 3: Second Person Writing

**Bad:**

```markdown
You should start by reading the configuration file.
You need to validate the input.
You can use the grep tool to search.
```

Why bad: Second person, not imperative form

**Good:**

```markdown
Start by reading the configuration file.
Validate the input before processing.
Use the grep tool to search for patterns.
```

Why good: Imperative form, direct instructions

### Mistake 4: Missing Resource References

**Bad:**

```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

[No mention of references/ or examples/]
```

Why bad: Claude doesn't know references exist

**Good:**

```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

- **`references/patterns.md`** - Detailed patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced techniques

### Examples

- **`examples/script.sh`** - Working example
```

Why good: Claude knows where to find additional information
