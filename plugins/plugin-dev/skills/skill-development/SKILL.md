# Skill Development for Claude Code Plugins

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills for Claude Code plugins.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### Skill Precedence

When multiple skills share the same name, precedence determines which loads:

1. Enterprise (managed settings) — highest priority
2. Personal (`~/.claude/skills/`)
3. Project (`.claude/skills/`)
4. Plugin skills — lowest priority

Plugin developers should use distinctive, ideally namespaced names (the plugin system auto-namespaces as `plugin-name:skill-name`) to avoid collisions with user or project skills.

### Skills and Commands: Unified Mechanism

Skills and commands share the same underlying mechanism (Skill tool). The choice depends on complexity needs:

- **Use commands** (`commands/foo.md`): Simple prompts without bundled resources
- **Use skills** (`skills/foo/SKILL.md`): Complex workflows needing scripts, references, or examples

Both support `$ARGUMENTS`, `[BANG]` bash execution, and frontmatter fields. Skills add bundled resources and progressive disclosure.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks
5. Visual output generation - Scripts that produce HTML/interactive visualizations

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." instead of "Use this skill when...").

#### Optional Frontmatter Fields

##### allowed-tools

Optionally restrict which tools Claude can use when the skill is active:

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code for best practices...
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

Use `allowed-tools` for:

- Read-only skills that shouldn't modify files
- Security-sensitive workflows
- Skills with limited scope

When specified, Claude can only use the listed tools without needing permission. If omitted, Claude follows the standard permission model.

##### context

Control how the skill's context is loaded:

```yaml
---
name: analysis-skill
description: Perform deep code analysis...
context: fork
---
```

**Values:**

- `fork` - Run skill in a subagent (separate context), preserving main agent's context
- Not specified - Run in main agent's context (default)

Use `context: fork` for:

- Skills that load large reference files
- Skills that might pollute the main context
- Expensive operations you want isolated

##### agent

Specify which agent type handles the skill when `context: fork` is set:

```yaml
---
name: exploration-skill
description: Explore codebase patterns...
context: fork
agent: Explore
---
```

**Values:**

- `Explore` - Fast agent for codebase exploration
- `Plan` - Architect agent for implementation planning
- `general` - General-purpose agent (default if `context: fork`)

Requires `context: fork` to be set.

##### skills

Load other skills into the forked agent's context:

```yaml
---
name: comprehensive-review
description: Full code review with testing...
context: fork
agent: general
skills:
  - testing-patterns
  - security-audit
---
```

Requires `context: fork` to be set. Only skills from the same plugin can be loaded.

##### user-invocable

Control whether the skill appears in the slash command menu:

```yaml
---
name: internal-review-standards
description: Apply internal code review standards...
user-invocable: false
---
```

**Default:** `true` (skills are visible in the `/` menu)

**Important:** This field only controls slash menu visibility. It does NOT affect:

- **Skill tool access** - Claude can still invoke the skill programmatically
- **Auto-discovery** - Claude still discovers and uses the skill based on context

Use `user-invocable: false` for skills that Claude should use automatically but users shouldn't invoke directly.

##### disable-model-invocation

Prevent Claude from programmatically invoking the skill via the Skill tool:

```yaml
---
name: dangerous-operation
description: Perform dangerous operation...
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

**Default:** `false` (programmatic invocation allowed)

Use for skills that should only be manually invoked by users, such as:

- Destructive operations requiring human judgment
- Interactive workflows needing user input
- Approval processes

**Visibility comparison:**

| Setting                          | Slash Menu | Skill Tool | Auto-Discovery |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| `user-invocable: true` (default) | Visible    | Allowed    | Yes            |
| `user-invocable: false`          | Hidden     | Allowed    | Yes            |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Visible    | Blocked    | Yes            |

##### model

Override which model handles the skill:

```yaml
---
name: quick-lint
description: Fast code linting checks...
model: haiku
---
```

**Values:** `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `inherit` (default), or a full model ID (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)

Use `haiku` for fast/cheap skills, `opus` for complex reasoning requiring maximum capability. Default behavior (`inherit`) uses the conversation's current model.

See `references/advanced-frontmatter.md` for detailed guidance on model selection.

##### hooks

Define scoped hooks that activate only when this skill is in use:

```yaml
---
name: secure-writer
description: Write files with validation...
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: Write
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate-write.sh"
---
```

Scoped hooks follow the same event/matcher/hook structure as `hooks.json` but are lifecycle-bound to the skill. Supported events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`.

See `references/advanced-frontmatter.md` for full syntax and comparison with `hooks.json`.

##### argument-hint

Provides autocomplete hint text shown in the `/` menu for the skill's expected arguments:

```yaml
---
argument-hint: "<file-path> [--verbose]"
---
```

Purely cosmetic — helps users understand what arguments the skill expects. Does not affect argument parsing.

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/schema.md` for database schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for templates

### Dynamic Content in Skills

Skills support dynamic content injection and variable substitution for context-aware behavior.

#### String Substitutions

Use variables in skill content that get replaced at runtime:

```markdown
The session ID is: ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
Arguments passed: $ARGUMENTS
```

**Available substitutions:**

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Arguments passed when skill is invoked (e.g., `/skill-name arg1 arg2`)
- `$ARGUMENTS[0]`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]`, etc. - Individual positional arguments (zero-indexed). `$ARGUMENTS[0]` is the first argument after the skill name.
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. - 1-indexed shorthand for positional arguments. `$1` is equivalent to `$ARGUMENTS[0]`, `$2` to `$ARGUMENTS[1]`, etc.
- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` - Current session identifier
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` - Plugin directory path

#### Dynamic Context Injection

Execute commands to inject their output into skill context using backtick syntax:

```markdown
## Current Project Status

The git status is:
[BANG]`git status --short`

Recent commits:
[BANG]`git log --oneline -5`
```

**Syntax:** `` [BANG]`command` ``

**Use cases:**

- Load current project state (git status, package.json)
- Include dynamic configuration
- Fetch environment-specific information

**Security note:** Commands execute in the user's environment. Only use trusted commands.

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\*)

\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.

**Visibility budget:** Claude Code allocates approximately 2% of the context window (or ~16KB fallback) for skill descriptions via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET`. When total description text across all installed skills exceeds this budget, some skills may be excluded from auto-discovery. Keep descriptions concise and move detail into the SKILL.md body and references. See `references/advanced-frontmatter.md` for optimization guidance.

### Context Management for Plugins

Skills should be designed for re-discoverability after auto-compaction. When Claude's context approaches its limit, older messages are automatically compressed. After compaction:

- **Descriptions survive**: Skill descriptions remain available (they're tool definitions, not conversation content)
- **Skill body is lost**: The full SKILL.md content from a previous invocation may be compacted away
- **Re-triggering works**: Users can invoke the skill again to reload its content

**`PreCompact` hook**: Plugins can use a `PreCompact` hook to preserve critical information before compaction occurs. Use this to save state that would otherwise be lost.

**Cross-plugin budget**: Skill descriptions from ALL installed plugins compete for the same visibility budget. Write concise, keyword-rich descriptions to maximize discoverability without consuming excessive space.

## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow these six steps. For detailed instructions on each step, see `references/skill-creation-workflow.md`.

1. **Understand the Skill**: Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used through user questions and feedback
2. **Plan Reusable Contents**: Analyze examples to identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful
3. **Create Structure**: Set up the skill directory with `mkdir -p skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}`
4. **Edit the Skill**: Write SKILL.md with proper frontmatter and imperative-form body; create bundled resources
5. **Validate and Test**: Check structure, trigger phrases, writing style, and progressive disclosure
6. **Iterate**: Improve based on real-world usage and feedback

### Key Writing Guidelines

- **Description**: Use third-person ("This skill should be used when...") with specific trigger phrases
- **Body**: Use imperative/infinitive form ("To create X, do Y"), not second person ("You should...")
- **Size**: Target 1,500-2,000 words; move detailed content to references/

## Plugin-Specific Considerations

### Skill Location in Plugins

Plugin skills live in the plugin's `skills/` directory:

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── commands/
├── agents/
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        ├── examples/
        └── scripts/
```

### Auto-Discovery

Claude Code automatically discovers skills:

- Scans `skills/` directory
- Finds subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
- Loads skill metadata (name + description) always
- Loads SKILL.md body when skill triggers
- Loads references/examples when needed

### No Packaging Needed

Plugin skills are distributed as part of the plugin, not as separate ZIP files. Users get skills when they install the plugin.

### Testing in Plugins

Test skills by installing plugin locally:

```bash
# Test with --plugin-dir
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin

# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
# Verify skill loads correctly
```

## Examples from Plugin-Dev

Study the skills in this plugin as examples of best practices:

**hook-development skill:**

- Excellent trigger phrases: "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", etc.
- Lean SKILL.md (2,125 words)
- 3 references/ files for detailed content
- 3 examples/ of working hooks
- 3 scripts/ utilities

**agent-development skill:**

- Strong triggers: "create an agent", "agent frontmatter", etc.
- Focused SKILL.md (1,896 words)
- References include the AI generation prompt from Claude Code
- Complete agent examples

**plugin-settings skill:**

- Specific triggers: "plugin settings", ".local.md files", "YAML frontmatter"
- References show real implementations (multi-agent-swarm, ralph-wiggum)
- Working parsing scripts

Each demonstrates progressive disclosure and strong triggering.
